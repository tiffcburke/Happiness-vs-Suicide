# Happiness-vs-Suicide

This project is in 4 parts: Data cleaning, data exploration using SQL, data visualization using Excel, 
and a final written report with screen shots summarizing what I have found and what I would recommend for the next steps.
The purpose of this project is to showcase my SQL, Excel, and writing skills to future employers. 
I am currently looking for a position as a Data/Business Analyst or a related field.
If you are interested in my work, please reach out. Thank you!
